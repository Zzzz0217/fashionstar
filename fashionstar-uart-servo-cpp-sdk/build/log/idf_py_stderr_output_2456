CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory D:/Fashion_Star/SDK/fashionstar-uart-servo-cpp-sdk/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/ubuntu/fashionstar/fashionstar-uart-servo-cpp-sdk/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "D:/Fashion_Star/SDK/fashionstar-uart-servo-cpp-sdk/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/ubuntu/fashionstar/fashionstar-uart-servo-cpp-sdk/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
